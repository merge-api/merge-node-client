/**
 * # The GeneralLedgerTransaction Object
 * ### Description
 * A General Ledger Entry is a record of a financial transaction that is posted to the general ledger, the central repository of a company’s financial data.
 *
 * The `GeneralLedgerTransaction` object is a singular endpoint to pull all transactions posted to a company’s general ledger. The transaction that generated the `GeneralLedgerTransaction` can be found by referencing the `underlying_transaction_type` and `underlying_transaction_remote_id` fields.
 *
 * The lines of a `GeneralLedgerTransaction` object will always have equal amounts of debits and credits.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 * Fetch from the `GET GeneralLedgerTransaction` endpoint and view a general ledger transaction.
