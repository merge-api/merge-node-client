 * # The Candidate Object
 * ### Description
 * The `Candidate` object is used to represent profile information about a given Candidate. Because it is specific to a Candidate, this information stays constant across applications.
 * ### Usage Example
 * Fetch from the `LIST Candidates` endpoint and filter by `ID` to show all candidates.
