 * # The Application Object
 * ### Description
 * The Application Object is used to represent a candidate's journey through a particular Job's recruiting process. If a Candidate applies for multiple Jobs, there will be a separate Application for each Job if the third-party integration allows it.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 * Fetch from the `LIST Applications` endpoint and filter by `ID` to show all applications.
